## Pack Background:

This is an update to a pack I have been making since Minecraft 1.2.5, but since I took a hiatus after 1.8 was announced, I never had the time to make an update, and here I am officially announcing the update to the pack on 1.12.2. Toxic Garbage Island stemmed from the idea my friend had of having extremely difficult mods, with mixture of unknown mods and combining them to make a kitchen-sink pack to promote those mods with the help of he larger mods to accompany them together. The modpack was dubbed as 'Toxic Garbage Island' because of the server we had; crazy environment develop with the dupes, glitches, bugs we found. The name was inspired by the song by Gojira, for the pack had so much unbalanced technology and magic that in a few weeks time the world became a polluted wasteland.

***Plastic form dead things, it is now so clear! How could I fail to understand!***

We had versions on 1.2.5, 1.4.7, 1.6.4 and 1.7.10. We want to keep the tradition going, and we even decided to create a public pack for all's enjoyment - along with our original community with a paid official server we maintain everyday. Thus, this pack will be the most polished I would have ever put out under the branding of Toxic Garbage Island; **no longer a kitchen sink but a polish modpack with crazy elements along with originality and experimentality.**

## Pack Description:

Abundant early game, with an engaging mid game to an ever so rich end game. 

However... that's not it, more is to be revealed throughout the modpack for you, there are recommended pathways to take, but if you take alternatives routes with lesser known mods; you may just be rewarded for your efforts. 

With lore to explore, there will be multiple parts to this spanning different minecraft versions. Starting 1.12.2.
